Welcome to the _printf project!

**Description** : 

This project is an implementation of the printf() function in C, which allows for the printing of strings and individual characters. The project implements the c and s options, which respectively allow for the printing of a single character and a string of characters.

The purpose of this project is to gain a better understanding of how the printf() function in the C standard library works, by recreating a simplified version.

**How to Use**:

The _printf() function is called using the following syntax:

**Examples**:

Here are some examples of using the _printf() function:
```
_printf("%c\n", 'A');
// prints: A

_printf("%s\n", "Hello, world!");
// prints: Hello, world!
```
**How to Compile**:

The project can be compiled using a standard C compiler such as gcc. The source file printf.c can be compiled with the following command:
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 -Wno-format *.c
```
